xpick - color picker for X
==========================

xpick captures the screen, creates a window showing a magnified image, 
and prints the picked color in the regular HEX format. It also has 
a bunch of command-line options and run time keyboard commands. For more 
information, see the man page.

It is written in pure Xlib and has no other dependencies.
